Purpose:
Would like to get a list of the last time users have logged into a machine.


Install Notes:


Copy over _modules and _states to the root of your filesystem.

If you have the defaults in place this would be

/srv/salt/_modules
/srv/salt/_states


If you are using gitfs

branchname/_modules
branchname/_states
